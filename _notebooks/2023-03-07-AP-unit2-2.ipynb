Thus base64 is used to transport and embed binary images into textual assets such as HTML and CSS.\n",

    "    - Binary is a base-2 numbering system that uses only two symbols, typically 0 and 1, to represent data. Hexadecimal, on the other hand, is a base-16 numbering system that uses 16 symbols to represent data, typically the digits 0-9 and the letters A-F. Base64 is a method of encoding data using a set of 64 characters, typically consisting of letters, digits, and symbols. Base64 is often used to represent binary data as text, for example in email attachments or in URLs.

    "    - Scaling an image refers to the process of resizing it to a larger or smaller size while maintaining its aspect ratio. The aspect ratio of an image is the ratio of its width to its height.\n",
