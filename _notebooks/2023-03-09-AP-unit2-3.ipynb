    "**Q1**: A researcher is analyzing data about students in a school district to determine whether there is a relationship between grade point average and number of absences. The researcher plans on compiling data from several sources to create a record for each student. Upon compiling the data, the researcher identifies a problem due to the fact that neither data source uses a unique ID number for each student. Which of the following best describes the problem caused by the lack of unique ID numbers?\n",
    "- Students who have the same name may be confused with each other.\n",
    "- A unique identifier would be required in order to distinguish between two students with the same first and last names.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Q2**: A team of researchers wants to create a program to analyze the amount of pollution reported in roughly 3,000 counties across the United States. The program is intended to combine county data sets and then process the data. Which of the following is most likely to be a challenge in creating the program?\n",
    "- Different counties may organize data in different ways.\n",
    "- It will be a challenge to clean the data from the different counties to make the data uniform. The way pollution data is captured and organized may vary significantly from county to county.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Q3**: A student is creating a Web site that is intended to display information about a city based on a city name that a user enters in a text field. Which of the following are likely to be challenges associated with processing city names that users might provide as input?\n",
    "- Users might enter abbreviations for the names of cities or Users might misspell the name of the city.\n",
    "-  Different users may abbreviate city names differently. This may require the student to clean the data to make it uniform before it can be processed.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Q4**: A database of information about shows at a concert venue contains the following information: Name of artist performing at the show, Date of show, Total dollar amount of all tickets sold. Which of the following additional pieces of information would be most useful in determining the artist with the greatest attendance during a particular month?\n",
    "- Average ticket price\n",
    "- This makes sense because if an artist's ticket cost more, they are considered more valuable, and the reason why a person might be considered more valuable is because they are more popular.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Q5**: A camera mounted on the dashboard of a car captures an image of the view from the driver’s seat every second. Each image is stored as data. Along with each image, the camera also captures and stores the car’s speed, the date and time, and the car’s GPS location as metadata. Which of the following can best be determined using only the data and none of the metadata?\n",
    "- The number of bicycles the car passed on a particular day\n",
    "-  Determining the number of bicycles the car encountered would require the use of image recognition software to examine the images collected by the camera. The images are the data collected and no metadata would be required.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Q6**: A teacher sends students an anonymous survey in order to learn more about the students’ work habits. The survey contains the following questions. Which of the following questions about the students who responded to the survey can the teacher answer by analyzing the survey results?\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Do students who enjoy the subject material tend to spend more time on homework each night than the other students do?\n",
    "2. Do students who spend more time on homework each night tend to spend less time studying for tests than the other students do?\n",
    "3. Do students who spend more time studying for tests tend to earn higher grades in the class than the other students do?\n",
    "\n",
    "- 1 and 2\n",
    "- The survey questions collect data on how much students enjoy a subject and how many hours they spend on hw and studying. As a result, putting together the data will give information about correlation between liking a subject and spending more time on hw (or any other combo). However, the data does not account for what type of student earns higher grades"

    "> Description from ChatGPT. The Titanic dataset is a popular dataset for data analysis and machine learning. In the context of machine learning, accuracy refers to the percentage of correctly classified instances in a set of predictions. In this case, the testing data is a subset of the original Titanic dataset that the decision tree model has not seen during training......After training the decision tree model on the training data, we can evaluate its performance on the testing data by making predictions on the testing data and comparing them to the actual outcomes. The accuracy of the decision tree classifier on the testing data tells us how well the model generalizes to new data that it hasn't seen before......For example, if the accuracy of the decision tree classifier on the testing data is 0.8 (or 80%), this means that 80% of the predictions made by the model on the testing data were correct....Chance of survival could be done using various machine learning techniques, including decision trees, logistic regression, or support vector machines, among others.\n",
