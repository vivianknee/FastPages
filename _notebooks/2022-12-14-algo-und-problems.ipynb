    "    - `HaltChecker` analyzes the program, program P, and its input, input I. If program P halts with input I, `HaltChecker` returns an output of \"halts\". If program P doesn't halt(runs forever) with input I, `HaltChecker` returns an output of \"never\". For example, in the code where it tests if variable number, the code runs forever, so `HaltChecker` returns an output of “never”.\n",
    "    - Then, we add another algorithm called Reverser which reverses `HaltChecker`'s output. So, if \"never\" is the output of `HaltChecker`, then the output of Reverser is “halts”. It's also the same the other way around: if `HaltChecker` has an output of \"halts\", then `Reverser` has an output of “never”.\n",
    "    - We combine these algorithms into one entire body of code.\n",
    "    - **Since `Reverser` is the algorithm at the end, hence giving the ultimate output, notice how it prints \"never\" when in fact there is an end(As proved by `HaltChecker`), and how it also prints \"halts\" when there is in fact is no end to the code(Also proved by `HaltChecker`). As a result, `HaltChecker` is inaccurate and this is an undecidable problem**\n",
