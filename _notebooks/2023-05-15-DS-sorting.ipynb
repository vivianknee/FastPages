    "    - Is a list and/or dictionary in python considered a primitive or collection type?  Why?\n",
    "        - In Python, both lists and dictionaries are considered collection types\n",
    "        - A primitive type refers to data types such as integers, floats, booleans, and characters. These types hold a single value and are not composed of smaller elements. On the other hand, collection types are data structures that can hold multiple values or objects.\n",
    "        - Lists in Python are ordered collections of elements, where each element can be of any data type. Lists are considered collection types because they can store multiple values in a single variable.\n",
    "    - Is the list passed into bubble sort \"pass-by-value\" or \"pass-by-reference? Describe why in relation to output.\n",
    "        - In Python, the list is passed by reference when passed into a function like bubble sort\n",
    "        - This means that any changes made to the list inside the function will affect the original list outside the function. The reason for this behavior is that when a list is passed to a function, its 'reference' is passed, rather than creating a new copy of the entire list.\n",
    "        - In the case of bubble sort, as elements are swapped within the function, the original list is modified. The modifications are reflected in the output because the function operates directly on the referenced list\n",
    "\n",
    "- Implement new cell(s) and/or organize cells to do the following.\n",
    "    - Create your own list\n",
    "    - Use your expertise sorting algorithm (selection, insertion, merge). Note, I got my bubble sort from Geek for Geeks and made modifications. Each student in a group should have a unique algorithm.\n",
    "    - Test your list with my bubble sort\n",
    "    - Test my list with your new sort\n",
    "    - Research analysis on sorting: comparisons, swaps, time.  Build this into your hacks.\n",
