    "    - my favorite taylor swift song is *Cruel Summer* because it brings back the best memories from the best summer of my life. I got to spend a month at UCSD and met a bunch of great people there. At the end of the program, the staff held a dance and my friends and I would just go crazy when *Cruel Summer* was playing. Even now, when I hear that song, I think of those memories and those people."
