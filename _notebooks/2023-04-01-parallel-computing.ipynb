    "- since two processors can run at the same time, I would run the two processes that take the longest at the same time first, that being the 50 and 30sec one. The 30sec one will finish before the 50sec one so another process can be run immediately after, that being the 10s one. The 10sec one would still finish before the 50sec one. Thus the minimum time to run all 3 algorithms would be 50s.\n",
