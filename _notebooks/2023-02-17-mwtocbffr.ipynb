    "## What is CORS?\n",
    "- Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) is an HTTP-header based mechanism that allows a server to indicate any origins (domain, scheme, or port) other than its own from which a browser should permit loading resources.\n",
    "- Its essentially a security feature\n",
    "\n",
    "How it goes down:\n",
    "1. The browser(frontend) sends the GET request with an extra Origin HTTP header to service.example.com (deployed backend) containing the domain that served the parent page <br>\n",
    "`Origin: http://www.example.com` // frontend url\n",
    "2. The server at service.example.com sends one of these responses:\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "`Access-Control-Allow-Origin: http://www.example.com` //backend allows the frontend url to access its contents <br>\n",
    "`Access-Control-Allow-Origin: *` //backend allows any site to access its contents"

    "- When trying to start a local server and test your frontend and backend connection, cors is often something that gets in the way.\n",
