Consider the following three algorithms, which are each intended to identify the people in the room who have the earliest birthday based on just the month and day. For example, a person born on February 10 is considered to have an earlier birthday than a person born on March 5. Which of the three algorithms will identify the correct people? I thought “Beginning with the number 1, ask if anyone was born on that day of any month. Continue with the numbers 2, 3, and so on until a positive response is received. If only one person responds, that person has the earliest birthday. If more than one person responds, determine which person was born in the earliest month, and that person or those persons have the earliest birthday.” this was a correct algorithm but it is not algorithm III will incorrectly determine that a person born on February 1 has an earlier birthday than a person born on January 5.]]></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Data Structures- Hashmaps, Sets, Hash Tables, Hashing and Collisions</title><link href="https://vivianknee.github.io/FastPages/2023/03/29/hashmaps.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Data Structures- Hashmaps, Sets, Hash Tables, Hashing and Collisions" /><published>2023-03-29T00:00:00-05:00</published><updated>2023-03-29T00:00:00-05:00</updated><id>https://vivianknee.github.io/FastPages/2023/03/29/hashmaps</id><author><name></name></author><summary type="html"><![CDATA[Observing hashmaps with python dictionaries]]></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Unit 4.3a Parallel Computing</title><link href="https://vivianknee.github.io/FastPages/2023/03/29/parallel-computing.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Unit 4.3a Parallel Computing" /><published>2023-03-29T00:00:00-05:00</published><updated>2023-03-29T00:00:00-05:00</updated><id>https://vivianknee.github.io/FastPages/2023/03/29/parallel-computing</id><author><name></name></author><summary type="html"><![CDATA[]]></summary></entry></feed>
