Notes/Process . . The code doesn’t work when the last value is positive but the rest are negative. In this case the answer was [-1, 0, 1] | The procedure traverses this list and eventually encounters the positive value 1. At this point, the procedure returns true when it should return false because the list does not contain only positive values. [-1, 0, 1] | . The Internet Quiz (10/10/22) . Outline . 3 question quiz testing my knowledge of networking including topics like packets, data, and transmitting information across the internet. | Score: 3/3 | . Notes/Process . When messages are transmitted across the internet, the message is broken into packets. The packets can be received in any order and still be reassembled by the recipient’s device | One of the primary uses of the open protocol on the internet is to provide a way to standardize data transmission between different devices. | The World Wide Web is a system of linked pages, programs, and files that is accessed via a network called the Internet. | . Program Design and Development Quiz (9/26/22) . Outline . 3 question quiz testing my knowledge of coding procedures | Score: 3/3 | . Notes/Process . . count is set to 1 outside of the loop | the loop adds 2 to the variable count each time meaning it is printing odd numbers | since the loop is set to stop once the count is greater than max, this means that the function will print all positive odd integers that are less than or qual to max | . . the variable result is set to x + y | a new result variable is set to the previous result divided by x | therefore, the printed result must be (x + y)/x where x must not be 0(then it would be undefined) | . . newList is = to numList | the elements j and k are interchanged for numList and newList | since j and k are indices, they must be valid values, hence the values of j and k must both be between 1 and length(numList) | . Collaboration Quiz (9/4/22) . Outline: . 3 question quiz testing my knowledge on collaboration | Score: 3/3 | . Notes/Process . Most of the questions in this quiz were answered based on common sense. Some answers had more positive connotations than others so picking the right answer was easy. | I understood that facilitating collaboration between group members was important. | I learned that user participation should be used to advance software development | I also learned that assembling a diverse team allows for multiple perspectives. | . Program Function and Purpose Quiz (9/4/22) . Outline . 6 question quiz testing my understanding of the behavior of code | Score: 6/6 | . Notes/Process . There was a set of questions looking for what data was necessary to fulfill the task. For those questions, I used logic and reasoning to figure out what was necessary and what was not. | . . this was a pretty self explanatory if statement. | It sets y as a variable when x is less than 0 meaning if y follows the criteria , it will print the value. | if the criteria set by the variable are not met, nothing will print. | .",

This basically meant that for one trimester of the year, teacher would teach the class on the basics of coding. AKA Scratch. I had to dig pretty far back to find some old projects. Here is the result of my search: . . Pretty revolutionary. . My next experience in computer science was when I joined Cyberpatriot. Cyberpatriot is essentially a competition where thousands of teams compete to secure different operating systems. Along the way, I learned how to configure different security settings on a computer, how to use powershell and cmd, and even a little bit of coding. Here’s a photo of my first year doing CyberPatriot, dating all the way back to 2018 when I was a itty bitty 7th grader. . . Now, fast forward to 2022. Here I am taking AP Computer Science Principles with very little knowledge on coding. Thankfully this class forces me to take the time to sit down and understand everything. Since its also a fast paced class, I have learned how to use GitHub, how to code with python, bash, javascript, etc, and how to collaborate all within the span of a couple weeks. . Psychology Takeaways . Vivian: I learned that things like your salary or your job aren’t what necessarily make you happy, rather data shows that people who spend more time engaging in social activities feel more happy overall. This goes along with being time affluent and avoiding burnout. | Amay: A student’s life is mostly centered around learning. A student will need to show evidence of their learning in almost every lesson they attend. Concentrating on their work and employing effective study techniques are two approaches to assist students in learning. We must value our time, as Laurie Santos discussed in her address. If we value our time, we have more of it and may use it to enhance our mental health. There are various ways we may make the most of our time. For instance, we may efficiently spend our time by concentrating on our task, doing it quickly, and avoiding rushing it at the last minute. In accordance with Laurie Santos’s discourse, we should also exercise self-control and develop healthy routines.When you have the opportunity to work hard and have a break from your responsibilities, you should do so. These actions would improve your academic performance as well as your general wellbeing since they would reduce the amount of homework you have to complete at home. | Sarah: | Emma: My biggest takeaway is to focus on what I can control. If I were to not win a lottery, I should realize that it was up to chance and there was nothing I could do to make me win, I shouldn’t spend any negative emotions on a situation I have no control over. However, when it comes to pursuing happiness, I do need to take effort to do things that bring me joy and surround myself with people I love. In this way, we won’t tie our self worth to our salary, where we live, etc. because we can be content with our life in any circumstance | .",

            "content": "Press this link to play my quiz! . Design &amp; Planning . First I decided on the content of my quiz: this theme is inspired by the popular game “Are you smarter than a 5th grader?” It consists of simple questions testing the range of your knowledge. . The next thing I decided to do was design the GUI/looks of my game. I decided on 5 questions, each question would have 4 answers and each answer would have an image to go along with it. This was my initial draft of the game looks. . . This is what my design looked like when it was finalized . . I also made a screen for incorrect answers and completing the entire quiz. When the user clicks a wrong answer, the code will take them to the incorrect screen and let them go to the beginning of the quiz. . 1. Program Purpose and Function . Purpose: The purpose of my program is to create a quiz that tests the user on their knowledge. I code the whole program using javascript. The code consists of user input as well as answers that can be selected. These answers are either correct or incorrect and depending on the answer selected or input given, the code will take the user to the next question or the incorrect screen. . Function: . Here is an example of my code for selectable answers. I used the blocks on event and set screen to change the screen off my game to the next question depending on the answer chosen. | . . Here is an example of my code for questions that take user input. | . . 2. Data Abstraction . I used a variable named “attempts” to store data. I set it equal to 0 at the beginning of my code to keep record of the users # of attempts at the end of the quiz. . 3. Managing Complexity . TBD . 4. Procedural Abstraction . I created a function called showResult. I called back to this function for every question I had demonstrating how I utilized the function for my quiz. . 5. Algorithm Implementation . In my code, I created a function/procedure that tells the user the result of their answer by either showing a check sign or a X sign. To do this, I first made a function called showResult. The function has 4 parameters: “result”, “nextScreen”, “image_y”, and “image_n”. The result parameter essentially states whether the correct answer was selected or not; if the result is “yes” then the function proceeds to show the element image_y and move on to the “nextScreen”. Otherwise, if result is equal to anything but “yes”, it will show the element image_n and add 1 to the attempts score. I also included a setTimeout block which hides both images initially, but when the images do show, the block makes them show for 1000ms or 1 s. Here is the actual code: . . 6. Testing/Debugging . I used trial and error to test my function. If the answer was correct, then the correct image would show. If the answer was incorrect, then the incorrect image would show. This confirmed that my function was working. In addition, if there was an error, the console log would tell me which line the error was at and I would fix it. . Challenges . One problem that I ran into was getting my code to output the final number of attempts the user needed to complete the quiz. At first, I wasn’t sure how to print strings as well as variables in one block. I also wasn’t sure how to change the text every time depending on different user performance. To solve this problem, I used multiple addition operator blocks to put multiple variables into one block. I set each variable to either a string or my attempts variable. My final code was this: . . Another problem I ran into was some error in my code that was not letting me output what I wanted to. The error that I was getting was that no matter how many incorrect attempts I made during testing, the final text always said 0. I then identified that the problem lied in the block “var = attempts + 1”. Somehow this block was not adding anything to the number of attempts causing it to always remain at 0. . But why? . I started searching google for the error as well as javascript syntax. The reason why my previous code wasn’t working was due to global variable shadowing which means that one variable shares a name with another, resulting in confusion. Since I defined the variable “attempts” as 0 in the beginning but then used the same name to add 1 to the variable, my initial variable shadowed the new one causing the variable to be lost when the function returned. After searching some more, I found that another method to add to a score variable was to use the syntax “++” in front of the variable. This is what my code looked like after the changes. . . Takeaways: . Here are some things I need to learn/apply in the future: . Learn how to effectively use lists/other collection types for quizzes or other create task ideas. Make use of lists to increase the efficiency of the code. (Data Abstraction and Managing Complexity) | An algorithm is a procedure within my function but procedural abstraction is calling back to the function and utilizing it in other sections of code | learn how to use iteration, sequencing, and selection to create an algorithm | use a list/dictionary for my answer and question pair values. Then use a for loop to loop through the dictionary using an index and confirm whether the User’s input is correct or incorrect. | .",

Alternate Methods of Iteration . Formatted Output of Dictionaries: Using For Loop with an Index . this code uses a for loop with the range and index syntax to print the dictionaries. It also does so in reverse order . Formatted output of Dictionary Managing data in Lists and Dictionaries is for the convenience of passing the data across the internet or preparing it to be stored into a database. Also, it is a great way to exchange data inside of our own programs. . Next, we will take the stored data and output it within our notebook. There are multiple steps to this process. . Preparing a function to format the data, the print_data() function receives a parameter called &quot;d_rec&quot; short for dictionary record. It then references different keys within [] square brackets. Preparing a function to iterate through the list, the for_loop() function uses an enhanced for loop that pull record by record out of InfoDb until the list is empty. Each time through the loop it call print_data(record), which passes the dictionary record to that function. Finally, you need to activate your function with the call to the defined function for_loop(). Functions are defined, not activated until they are called. By placing for_loop() at the left margin the function is activated. . def print_data(d_rec): #formatting print(d_rec[&quot;FirstName&quot;], d_rec[&quot;LastName&quot;]) # using comma puts space between values print(&quot; t&quot;, &quot;Residence:&quot;, d_rec[&quot;Residence&quot;]) # t is a tab indent print(&quot; t&quot;, &quot;Birth Day:&quot;, d_rec[&quot;DOB&quot;]) print(&quot; t&quot;, &quot;Favorite Movie&quot;, d_rec[&quot;Fav_Movie&quot;]) print(&quot; t&quot;, &quot;Email:&quot;, d_rec[&quot;Email&quot;]) print(&quot; t&quot;, &quot;Best Treats: &quot;, end=&quot;&quot;) # end=&quot;&quot; make sure no return occurs print(&quot;, &quot;.join(d_rec[&quot;Best_Treats&quot;])) # join allows printing a string list with separator print() # for loop iterates on length of InfoDb def for_loop(): print(&quot;For loop with index output n&quot;) length = len(infoDb) #figures out the length of the list infoDb (which is 2 because there are 2 dictionaries in the list) ran = range(length) #defines ran as the range of the length.

With fastpages you can save your jupyter notebooks into the _notebooks folder at the root of your repository, and they will be automatically be converted to Jekyll compliant blog posts! . Front Matter . The first cell in your Jupyter Notebook or markdown blog post contains front matter. Front matter is metadata that can turn on/off options in your Notebook. It is formatted like this: . # &quot;My Title&quot; &gt; &quot;Awesome summary&quot; - toc:true- branch: master - badges: true - comments: true - author: Hamel Husain &amp; Jeremy Howard - categories: [fastpages, jupyter] . Setting toc: true will automatically generate a table of contents | Setting badges: true will automatically include GitHub and Google Colab links to your notebook. | Setting comments: true will enable commenting on your blog post, powered by utterances. | . The title and description need to be enclosed in double quotes only if they include special characters such as a colon. More details and options for front matter can be viewed on the front matter section of the README. . Markdown Shortcuts . A #hide comment at the top of any code cell will hide both the input and output of that cell in your blog post. . A #hide_input comment at the top of any code cell will only hide the input of that cell. . The comment #hide_input was used to hide the code that produced this. . put a #collapse-hide flag at the top of any cell if you want to hide that cell by default, but give the reader the option to show it: . import pandas as pd import altair as alt . . put a #collapse-show flag at the top of any cell if you want to show that cell by default, but give the reader the option to hide it: . cars = &#39;https://vega.github.io/vega-datasets/data/cars.json&#39; movies = &#39;https://vega.github.io/vega-datasets/data/movies.json&#39; sp500 = &#39;https://vega.github.io/vega-datasets/data/sp500.csv&#39; stocks = &#39;https://vega.github.io/vega-datasets/data/stocks.csv&#39; flights = &#39;https://vega.github.io/vega-datasets/data/flights-5k.json&#39; . . place a #collapse-output flag at the top of any cell if you want to put the output under a collapsable element that is closed by default, but give the reader the option to open it: . print(&#39;The comment #collapse-output was used to collapse the output of this cell by default but you can expand it.&#39;) . The comment #collapse-output was used to collapse the output of this cell by default but you can expand it. . . Interactive Charts With Altair . Charts made with Altair remain interactive.

Where YEAR is a four-digit number, MONTH and DAY are both two-digit numbers, and filename is whatever file name you choose, to remind yourself what this post is about. .md is the file extension for markdown files. . The first line of the file should start with a single hash character, then a space, then your title. This is how you create a “level 1 heading” in markdown. Then you can create level 2, 3, etc headings as you wish but repeating the hash character, such as you see in the line ## File names above. . Basic formatting . You can use italics, bold, code font text, and create links. Here’s a footnote 1. Here’s a horizontal rule: . . Lists . Here’s a list: . item 1 | item 2 | . And a numbered list: . item 1 | item 2 | Boxes and stuff . This is a quotation . . You can include alert boxes …and… . . You can include info boxes Images . . Code .

I also took notes on my collegeboard MC quizzes | . 6 | Deployment | N/A | We worked with AWS | . 5 | UI Starters | Review Ticket 5 | This week we learned how to use HTML Fragments and Javascript to create objects, arrays, and datatables. Here is me using Javascript with Jupyter notebook and the kernel. I also made a separate javascript table to show what books I like. Finally, I made a frontend table using HTML. | . 4 | Python Web Server Project | Review Ticket 4 | In the video I made for week 4, I go over my CSP Journey and takeaways from the psychology video as well as the process I took to do my local server | . 3 | Creative Development | Review Ticket 3 | This week, we focused on creating a sample create task in preparation for the AP exam using javascript and code.org app lab. Here is the blog I wrote during the process. | . 2 | Data Abstraction | Review Ticket 2 | This week we started learning about Lists, Dictionaries, and Iterations and how to store data with them. We learned how to print and format dictionaries as well as do other more advanced things with them. In addition, we also messed around with html and the themes of our website. For example we applied a dark mode css file which changed the entire look of the site. | . 1 | Intro to Python | Review Ticket 1 | This week was super busy and more code heavy. Specifically, we began using python and bash. Using python, we made a Python Quiz and with bash we created a Bash Tool Check. The bash tool check made sure that we had all the necessary programs installed. This week was also an opportunity to personalize our website so I made a page consisting of My Art with Images and Tables. Finally, we had to show proof of our blogging both in csp which I did through APCSP Vocab and for Schoolwork outside of csp. | . 0 | Tool Setup | Review Ticket 0 | We learned how to make our first markdown posts and jupyter notebooks. My first makedown post was my About Me and my First Post. In order to do this, we had to set up wsl, vscode, and download numerous other programs like anaconda, bash, python, and more. | .",
