# APCSP Blog-The Process and Progress
>This notebook will follow my APCSP journey. Covering packages, code, setup, and more.

## Week 1
- I downloaded all the neccesary tools. Some I have already used and others were new to me. For example, I've never used markdown, jupyter notebooks, or wsl before. However, I did have some experience with linux and html prior to taking this class
- I created my first post and notebook using python hello and markdown syntax. Markdown also uses html so I like that I was able to switch between markdown and html code.
- I also learned how to add images and through trial and error, I have discovered 2 ways to add an image
    1. Using the html method of <img scr= > 
    2. ![](<p>{{ site.baseurl }}</p>/filepath/image.png)
- I learned a bunch of new vocab terms in regard to computer science. This includes commands and terms to describe different syntaxes
