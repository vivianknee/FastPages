<h2>APCSP Blog</h2>

## Week 1
- I downloaded all the necessary tools. Some I have already used and others were new to me. For example, I've never used markdown, jupyter notebooks, or wsl before. However, I did have some experience with linux and html prior to taking this class
- I created my first post and notebook using python hello and markdown syntax. Markdown also uses html so I like that I was able to switch between markdown and html code
- I learned a bunch of new vocab terms in regard to computer science. This includes commands and terms to describe different syntaxes
- I learned how to create a python quiz in which I give the computer an input and it gives me the answer or message as an output
- I also used bash to test to see if I had all the packages required installed
- I also learned how to add images and through trial and error, I have discovered 2 ways to add an image
  - Using the html method of img scr="" 
  - ![]({{ site.baseurl }}/filepath/image.png)  

## Week 2
- I learned about lists and dictionaries and how to use them to store data and create cool things like quizzes and inputs
- I also learned about the importance of HTML and how to change the theme of my website. I also messed around with dark mode and I am trying to make a toggle button for dark and light mode
