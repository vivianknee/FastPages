        <ul>
            <li>A sig fig is one that is reliably known</li>
            <li>A 0 after a decimal point but before digits that are 1-9 are insignificant ex: 0.09 has 1 sigfig</li>
            <li>A 0 after a digit 1-9 and a decimal are significant ex: 0.90 has 2 sigfigs</li>
            <li>A 0 at the end of a whole number with no decimal point is insignificant ex: 90 has 1 sigfig</li>
            <li>A 0 in between digits 1-9 is significant ex: 909 has 3 sigfigs</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>Motion in One Dimension
        <ul>
            <li><b>Kinematics</b>: describes motion while ignoring the agents that caused the motion</li>
            <li><b>Position</b>: defined in terms of a frame of reference(usually the x or y axis)</li>
            <li><b>Displacement</b>: change in position during some time interval. It is solved with the equation Î”x=xf-xi</li>
            <li><b>Vector</b>: quantities that need both magnitude(size or numerical value) and direction(positive or negative) to describe them</li>
            <li><b>Scalar</b>: quantities that are described by magnitude only (time, mass, speed)</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>Dimensional Analysis</li>
