# 5.3 Computer Bias
Google “What age groups use Facebook” vs “… TikTok”? What does the data say? Is there purposeful exclusion in these platforms? Is it harmful? Should it be corrected? Is it good business? 
- The age group that uses Facebook are people ages 25-34
- The age group uses tik tok are people ages 10-19
- there are purposeful exclusions on platforms like tik tok. For example, people who are 13 and under can't sign up and tik tok does this to prevent young children from viewing possibly inappropriate content so it's beneficial in that sense so it shouldn't be corrected.
It's bad business for a company like Facebook which is primarily a platform for older people. Facebook thus loses younger users.

Why do virtual assistants have female voices? Amazon, Alexa Google, Apple Siri. Was this purposeful? Is it harmful? Should it be corrected? Is it good business?
- using only female voices might imply to some that females fill the role of "submissiveness" as they serve the owner of the virtuous devices. It might also promote the bias that women are assistants.
- this should be corrected and virtual assistants should include more male voices to make things more balanced
- it's good business because people might find female voices more pleasing and thus be more inclined to buy the device so in that sense, it's very purposeful that these companies choose to set the voice to female by default.

Talk about an algorithm that influences your decisions, think about these companies (ie FAANG - Facebook, Amazon, Apple,Netflix, Google)
- there are algorithms that different companies use to capture the users attention. For example, tik tok has a "for you page" which shows videos that appeal to the users interests and these interests are filled out beforehand by the user. In addition this algorithm pushes trends to the user which can have harmful effects such as in the case of the "devious lick" trend. In addition companies like Facebook and Amazon have ads on the side of your screen based on your search history.

Does the owner of the computer think this was intentional?
If yes or no, justify you conclusion.
- I don't think the owner thinks its intentional because he's carrying a light joking tone throughout the video showing how he's more so making fun of the machine vs being angry at it.

How do you think this happened?
- the lightning might have been bad or during development, the developers may have only tested the technology with white testers thus failed to recognize the errors when a black man tested the tech

Is this harmful? Was it intended to be harmful or exclude?
- this is harmful because it's unintentionally exclusive

Should it be corrected?
What would you or should you do to produce a better outcome?
- this should be corrected and developers definitely need to solve the tech to make it inclusive of people with all skin colors. I think the company needs to do more testing.

Write summary/thoughts/conclusions from each of the exercises above. Focus on avoiding Bias in algorithms or code you write.
- Every product that is developed will have some type of bias. The best way to combat this bias is to get feedback and opinions from a diverse group of people. That way, any software can have an inclusive usage and be good for everyone 

# 5.4 Crowd Sourcing
We have all experienced Crowdsourcing by using external data through API’s, namely RapidAPI. This data has influenced how we code and shown possibilities in obtaining and analyzing data. Discuss APIs you have used.
- I have used an API with symptoms including cough, fever, etc. I used this in my tri1 project. Our crossover team used a Wikipedia API.

We have all participated in code Crowdsourcing by using GitHub. Many of you have forked from the Teacher repository, or exchanged code with fellow students. Not only can we analyze GitHub code, but we can obtain profiles and history about the persons coding history. What is the biggest discovery you have found in GitHub?
- the biggest discovery I've found on GitHub is GitHub.dev. It allows you to look at peoples code and it's format through the web.

Kaggle datasets for code and science exploration. The avenue of data points us youtube or netflix channels. Analyzing crowd data helps us make decisions. Exam top 10 to 20. Did you see anything interesting?
- there is a lot of medical apis, car apis, covid data, election results, and even arrests in the city of Chicago. 

CompSci has 150 ish principles students. Describe a crowdsource idea and how you might initiate it in our environment?
- I think slack is in a sense apcsps form of crowd sourcing. Important information is sent there and people can ask questions and get answers on the slack as well

What about Del Norte crowdsourcing? Could your project be better with crowdsourcing?
- Del Norte definitely needs better crowd sourcing. Currently, a lot of decisions made by the school are done by the staff or ASB, however regular students don't really have a chance to say much. I think making a board of students could help with this problem. These students could get feedback from classes and then give that input to those who make final decisions. 
- my own project could be better with crowd sourcing because it would gain more advice and perspectives thus allowing it to grow

What kind of data could you capture at N@tM to make evening interesting? Perhaps use this data to impress Teachers during finals week.
- I could make a google form, but to make it more csp related, I could set up a SQLite database to collect feedback from every student who stops to see the project. This feedback would all be collected in one place.
