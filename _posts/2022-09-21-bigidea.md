1. Program Purpose and Function

Our Programs function is to help people with different illnesses identify their sickness by entering different symptoms that we are pulling from a health API

2. Data Abstraction
There will most likely be variables involved to make our code more organized.

3. Managing Complexity
 
4. Procedural Abstraction
 
5. Algorithm Implementation
We are going to create a function that takes user inputs and compares it to a list of data that we have from the api. Based on the user input, we will code the function to respond accordingly. How is still to be determined
6. Testing
