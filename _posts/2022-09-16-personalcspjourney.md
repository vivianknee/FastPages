## My Personal CSP Journey
The very first coding class I took was in middle school. It was a class provided by the school known as "exploratory". This basically meant that for one trimester of the year, teacher would teach the class on the basics of coding. AKA Scratch. I had to dig pretty far back to find some old projects. Here is the result of my search:

Pretty revolutionary.

My next experience into computer science was when I joined Cyberpatriot. Cyberpatriot is essentially a competition where thousands of teams compete to secure different operating systems. Along the way, I learned how to configure different security settings on a computer, how to use powershell and cmd, and even a little bit of coding. Here's a photo of my first year doing CyberPatriot, dating all the way back to 2018 when I was a itty bitty 7th grader.

Now, fast forward to 2022. Here I am taking AP Computer Science Principles with very little knowledge on coding. Thankfully this class forces me to take the time to sit down and understand everything. Since its also a fast paced class, I have learned how to use GitHub, how to code with python, bash, javascript, etc, and how to collaborate all within the span of a couple weeks.
