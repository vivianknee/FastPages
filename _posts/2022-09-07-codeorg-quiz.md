## Step 1: Planning
First I decided on the content of my quiz: Are you smarter than a 5th grader? This theme is inspired by the popular game "Are you smarter than a 5th grader?" It consists of simple questions testing the range of your knowledge.

## Step 2: Design
The next thing i decided to do was design the GUI/looks of my game. I decided on 5 questions, each question would have 4 answers and each answer would have an image to go along with it. This was my initial draft of the game looks.

This is what my design looked like when it was finalzied

## Step 3: Code
Then I decided to try and code a basic quiz. This way I could figure out how the quiz actually works. From that point, I could focus more on customization and design.

## Step 4: Debugging
