## Step 1: Planning
First I decided on the content of my quiz: Are you smarter than a 5th grader? This theme is inspired by the popular game "Are you smarter than a 5th grader?" It consists of simple questions testing the range of your knowledge.

## Step 2: Design
The next thing i decided to do was design the GUI/looks of my game. I decided on 5 questions, each question would have 4 answers and each answer would have an image to go along with it. This was my initial draft of the game looks.

This is what my design looked like when it was finalized

I also made a screen for incorrect answers and completing the entire quiz. When the user clicks a wrong answer, the code will take them to the incorrect screen and let them go to the beginning of the quiz.

## Step 3: Code
Then I decided to try and code a basic quiz. This way I could figure out how the quiz actually works. From that point, I could focus more on customization and design. My plan for the code was to use the "on event" and "set screen" blocks to change the screen off my game to the next question.
