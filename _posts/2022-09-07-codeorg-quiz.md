## 1. Program Purpose and Function
**Purpose:** The purpose of my program is to create a quiz that tests the user on their knowledge. The code consists of user input as well as answers that can be selected. These answers are either correct or incorrect and depending on the answer selected or input given, the code will take the user to the next question or the incorrect screen.

**Function**
- Here is an example of my code for selectable answers. I used the blocks "on event" and "set screen" to change the screen off my game to the next question depending on the answer chosen.

- Here is an example of my code for questions that take user input.

## 2. Data Abstraction
## 3. Managing Complexity
## 4. Procedural Abstraction
## 5. Algorithm Implementation
## 6. Testing/Debugging
One problem that I ran into was getting my code to output the final number of attempts the user needed to complete the quiz. My initial code used variables and the "set text" block in order to output this, however this was not working so I had to devise a better method.

## Step 1: Planning
First I decided on the content of my quiz: Are you smarter than a 5th grader? This theme is inspired by the popular game "Are you smarter than a 5th grader?" It consists of simple questions testing the range of your knowledge.

## Step 2: Design
The next thing I decided to do was design the GUI/looks of my game. I decided on 5 questions, each question would have 4 answers and each answer would have an image to go along with it. This was my initial draft of the game looks.

This is what my design looked like when it was finalized

I also made a screen for incorrect answers and completing the entire quiz. When the user clicks a wrong answer, the code will take them to the incorrect screen and let them go to the beginning of the quiz.
