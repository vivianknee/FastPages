## My Process
I encountered a lot of errors during this process:
<ul>
    <li>I got the error telling me that I didn't have wsl 2 installed. I had to do the whole process of installing it, then changing settings in docker for the make server command to finally work</li>
    <li>I got an error saying that I didn't have the permission to run certain volumes so I had to run make server with "sudo" in front of it to bypass permissions</li>
    <li>I got an error where when I opened the link to my website, it told me that the link didn't exist</li>
</ul>
