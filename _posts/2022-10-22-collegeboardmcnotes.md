- The code doesn't work when the last value is positive but the rest are negative. In this case the answer was [-1, 0, 1]
- The procedure traverses this list and eventually encounters the positive value 1. At this point, the procedure returns true when it should return false because the list does not contain only positive values. [-1, 0, 1]

## The Internet Quiz (10/10/22)
Outline
- 3 question quiz testing my knowledge of networking including topics like packets, data, and transmitting information across the internet.
- Score: 3/3

Notes/Process
- When messages are transmitted across the internet, the message is broken into packets. The packets can be received in any order and still be reassembled by the recipientâ€™s device
- One of the primary uses of the open protocol on the internet is to provide a way to standardize data transmission between different devices.
- The World Wide Web is a system of linked pages, programs, and files that is accessed via a network called the Internet.

## Program Design and Development Quiz (9/26/22)
Outline
- 3 question quiz testing my knowledge of coding procedures
- Score: 3/3

Notes/Process

- count is set to 1 outside of the loop
- the loop adds 2 to the variable count each time meaning it is printing odd numbers
- since the loop is set to stop once the count is greater than max, this means that the function will print all positive odd integers that are less than or qual to max

- the variable result is set to x + y
- a new result variable is set to the previous result divided by x
- therefore, the printed result must be (x + y)/x where x must not be 0(then it would be undefined)

- newList is = to numList
- the elements j and k are interchanged for numList and newList
- since j and k are indices, they must be valid values, hence the values of j and k must both be between 1 and length(numList)

## Collaboration Quiz (9/4/22)
Outline:
- 3 question quiz testing my knowledge on collaboration
- Score: 3/3

Notes/Process
- Most of the questions in this quiz were answered based on common sense. Some answers had more positive connotations than others so picking the right answer was easy.
- I understood that facilitating collaboration between group members was important.
- I learned that user participation should be used to advance software development
- I also learned that assembling a diverse team allows for multiple perspectives.

## Program Function and Purpose Quiz (9/4/22)
Outline
- 6 question quiz testing my understanding of the behavior of code
- Score: 6/6

Notes/Process
- There was a set of questions looking for what data was necessary to fulfill the task. For those questions, I used logic and reasoning to figure out what was necessary and what was not.

- this was a pretty self explanatory if statement. 
- It sets y as a variable when x is less than 0 meaning if y follows the criteria , it will print the value.
- if the criteria set by the variable are not met, nothing will print.
