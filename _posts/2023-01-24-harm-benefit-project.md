2. **Talk about dopamine issues above. Real? Parent conspiracy? Anything that is impacting your personal study and success in High School?**
Sometimes when i'm on my computer, I lose track of time and end up spending my entire day on my computer. This can be both good and bad. Far starters, it has a negative impact because I don't spend any time with my family or socializing with people in person. Since a computer allows me to do everything online including communicating with others, it creates a lazy mindset that makes me less social and outgoing. However, computers are also a crucial and beneficial part of my life because it allows me organize and complete my school work. In addition, my computer gives me access to the internet which provides me with millions of resources that are just a click away.

# CPT Questions
1. **Think of three beneficial effects of your projects based on 5.1 Unit**
    - Our project can help people make an informed decision about what type of car they are looking to buy. Users can gain specific information on the type, model, mileage, and price of a car.
    - Our project can help people save time when buying a car. Instead of having to spend hours going from car dealer to car dealer asking questions about a car, the user can find all the information they need in one place on one website.
    - Since our project has a sign up and log in feature, this means that users can "save" cars their account and refer beck to them by logging in to the website again. This feature makes looking for information easy and fast.

2. **Think of a potential harmful effect of your project.**
    - I think that our website could potentially be a disruptor in how people look for a car to buy. Instead of seeing the car in person, the user might base their purchase only on what they see online but when they actually get the car, it isn't what they were anticipating. This can create some false expectations which wouldn't be good for someone trying to make an important purchase.

3. **What concerns do you have personally about the digital divide? For yourself or for others.**
    - Its obviously very upsetting that digital divide is something that exists. I think its very unfair that not everyone has access to the same opportunities and education, something that is partially effected by the digital divide. Those who do not have computers lose access to the internet and all the information that comes with it. As a result, they fall behind other, not because they lack the skill, but because they lack the resources which is extremely unfair.

4. **Answer with an opinion and learnings so far this year:  What are pros/cons on internet blockers at router and lack of admin password on lab machines at school?**

    	<ul>
        	<li>could block websites and videos that are actually informational and needed during classroom work-time</li>
            <li>This creates a bias against what should and should not be filtered. Some content that is actually purposeful and informational might get blocked just because of it's source which is considered "bad"</li>
            <li> students don't have access to good internet which can impair the quality of learning </li>
