<blockquote>
<p>To begin the API journey.  You need to find an API provider.</p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li>RapidAPI is a great option.  You must setup and account, but there are many free options.</li>
<li>Goto this page for starters, the <a href="https://rapidapi.com/hub">RapidAPI Hub</a>- Under Code Snippets pick Python - Requests</li>
</ul>
<p>RapidAPI, you will select Python Requests type of code to work with you Notebook.</p>
<ul>
<li>The url is the endpoint to which the API is directed</li>
<li>The headers is a dictionary data structure to send special messaging to the endpoint </li>
<li>The requests.request() python function is used to send a request and retrieve their responses</li>
<li>The response variable receives result of of the request in JSON text</li>
</ul>
<p>Next step, is to format the response according to your data science needs</p>
