<p><strong>Welcome to My Blog</strong></p>

<h1>Wondering who i am?<h1>
<p>My name is Vivian and I am a junior at Del Norte High School. Not sure if I strictly want to go down the path of "software engineer" since coding is both frustrating and rewarding at the same time. I enjoy doing graphic design, digital art, and cybersecurity<p>
