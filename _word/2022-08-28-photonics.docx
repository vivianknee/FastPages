Fundamentals
- Frequency and wavelength 
    - increase in frequency = increase in speed = short wavelength (vice v versus)
    - Frequency can’t change
    - Light of different color have different frequencies 
    - Smaller wavelength = more information 
- Light sources
    - incandescent: glows because it’s hot (lightbulbs)
    - Line source: glows because e- are transitioning from higher to lower energy levels (fluorescent tube)
    - The difference of energy as the e- transfer is called photons (packets of light or quantum of light)
- Snell's Law
    - light follows the path of least time, the law of refraction 
- Optical fiber
    - data is sent as individual pulses of laser light on fiber
    - Different data streams can be sent on each color of light
- Atoms and orbitals
    - as more atoms come close together separation of energy levels becomes smaller and the energy leveled form energy bands
    - Smaller energy band = better conductor of electricity and e- can move easier

The PN Junction: Theory
- Electrons and holes
    - photons with energy greater than E() can excite an electron from the valence band  to the conduction band 
    - When a photon breaks a bond in a molecule, a free electron and a hole(empty electron state)  in the molecule are created in the valence band
    - If the positive terminal of a battery is applied on the right: The hole (positively charged) moves left while the e- (negatively charged) moves right towards the positive side
- Example of Holes and Doping
    - Extra e- go to the conduction band while holes are created in the valence band
    - e- move from right to left and leave behind + charge on the n side.  Holes move from left to right and leave behind - charge on the P side
    - e- then attract to the n side because it’s positive and holes attract to the P side because it is - charged
    - Ionized donors are positively charged because they donate e- to the p side causing it to leave behind a positive charge on the n side
    - Ionized acceptors are negatively charged because it loses e- to the n side, leaving behind a negative charge on the p side
- Electron Volt
    - unit of energy
    - The energy which an e- acquires as it traverses a difference in the electrostatic potential of one volt in a vacuum 
    - 1 volt= 1.602*10-19 J
    - The internal electric field of the PN junction decreases when an external voltage is applied. 
- Pn Junctions for LEDs
    - created with p-type and n-type material. 
    - P-type material consists of holes while n-type consists of e-
    - Both materials combine and give off light in the form of photons. e- must lose energy to merge with holes
    - The amount of photons produced determines color and power

Metal oxide semiconductor
- When a negative bias is applied to the gate in the structure, an electric field is formed pointing from the bottom of the page to the top causing holes to move toward the oxide semiconductor interface
- Electrons cannot flow through the oxide
- The efficiency of a solar panel cannot be 100% because not all photons have sufficient energy to excite an electron. Thus, some photons pass through the solar panel while others are converted to heat energy. 2. In the diagram on the slides, the holes in the P-type material pass into the wire while electrons move into the P-type material because it is attracted to the positive charge on the plate (given sufficient voltage). Since these electrons cannot pass through the oxide, the P-type material is effectively changed into an N-type material. 3. Channel length

Polarization
- Unpolarized light: e field is always at a right angle to the direction of travel. It can be horizontal, vertical, and at any angle in between
- Linear polarization: electric field and magnetic field are confined to a plane along the direction of propagation 
- Circular polarization: at each point, the electromagnetic field of the wave has a constant magnitude and is rotating at a constant rate in a plane perpendicular to the direction of the wave. Circular polarization results from the combination of two axes of linear polarization. Electric and magnetic fields are out of phase by 90 degrees.

Brewster angle
- Light incident on the surface is absorbed and then reradiated by oscillating electric dipoles in the media
- Polarization is perpendicular to the light direction
- Dipoles do not radiate energy in the direction of the dipole moment

Lasers
- Laser principle
    - Lasers use the population inversion of electrons between specific electron energy levels to produce stimulated emission, and produce a certain wavelength of light
- How to make a laser
    - Find a good material
    - Find an appropriate pumping method

Optical coupling
- The ring resonator can support a discrete amount of waves
- The separation between waveguide and ring resonator determines the size of the coupling region
- Refractive indices between the waveguide and ring resonator also affect coupling region size
- Critical coupling: when the input wavelength is equal to the ring resonator. That wave can pass through the ring

Lens
- Converging and diverging surfaces
- Rays passing through the center do not refract
- If the surface is convex, it is converging in the sense that parallel rays bend toward each other after passing the surface. (f is positive)
- If the surface is concave, it is a diverging surface. The rays appear to come from point F, the second focal point. (f is negative)
- Properties of images
    - If the object is placed outside the focal length f of the lens: the image is real and the image is inverted
    - If the object is outside of 2f, the image is smaller
    - At 2f image is the same size as the object
    - If the object is placed inside focal length f then the image is virtual, not inverted, and always bigger
- Power of lens
    - 1/f
    - Describes the extent that the lens bends the light rays
    - F is in meter, power(P) is in diopter(D)
    - F = 50cm P =2D   Do = 2f-
    - 1/dobject + 1/dimage = 1/f
    - magnification = hi/ho = di/do
- Resolution
    - x1/2 = 1,22f * wavelength/D

Optical fibers
- Core
    - Silica glass with germanium
    - The purpose is to signal transmission
- Cladding
    - Made of silica glass
    - The purpose is to contain the signal in the center
- Coating
    - Dual layer UV cured acrylate
    - The purpose is protection for mechanical
- Glass giber
    - Glass core and glass cladding
    - Ultra pure

Quantum cryptography
- EX 1: Alice sends 1 in x basis (45°), and Bob measures in x basis
1 in x basis is 45 degrees so the polarization rotator on Alice's side bends the light 45 degrees. Bob measures in x basis so the light is bent an additional 45 degrees at the second polarization rotator. The light is now bent 90 degrees and will go vertical when it hits the polarizing beamsplitter.

Young’s double split experiment
= r = m * wavelength m = 0,1,2
- m * wavelength = d *y/x m= 0,1,2
- The laser light passes through a double slit producing interference. The distance between the slit enters is 0.5 mm and the distance from the center of the pattern to the first order maximum on a screen 3 m away is 0.3 cm. What is the wavelength of the light?
- Wavelength = d* y/x = (0.5mm)(0.3cm)/3m = 500 nm

Optical microscopy
- The main parameters considered in the design using a microscope are magnification, resolution, and contrast
Contrast
- Most biological specimens are transparent when illuminated by visible light (bright field)
- Our eyes can only detect amplitude, not phase shift of the light wave. When the wave shifts, the intensity changes
