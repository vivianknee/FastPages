| Week | Sprint | Review Ticket | Summary |
|-|-|-|-|
| 7 | API | [Review Ticket 7](https://github.com/vivianknee/FastPages/issues/12#issue-1402364510) | I learned how to format and pull data from an [API](https://vivianknee.github.io/FastPages/week7/rapidapi). I also took notes on my collegeboard MC [quizzes](https://vivianknee.github.io/FastPages/week7/2022/10/22/collegeboardmcnotes.html) |
| 6 | Deployment | N/A | We worked with AWS |
| 5 | UI Starters | [Review Ticket 5](https://github.com/vivianknee/FastPages/issues/11#issue-1384505077) | This week we learned how to use HTML Fragments and Javascript to create objects, arrays, and datatables. Here is me using [Javascript with Jupyter notebook](https://vivianknee.github.io/FastPages/week5/jsKernel) and the kernel. I also made a separate [javascript table](https://vivianknee.github.io/FastPages/frontend/jsTable) to show what books I like. Finally, I made a [frontend](https://vivianknee.github.io/FastPages/_pages/Frontend.html) table using HTML. |
| 4 | Python Web Server Project | [Review Ticket 4](https://github.com/vivianknee/FastPages/issues/10#issue-1378861672) | In the video I made for week 4, I go over my [CSP Journey and takeaways from the psychology video](https://vivianknee.github.io/FastPages/markdown/week4/2022/09/16/personalcspjourney.html) as well as the [process](https://vivianknee.github.io/FastPages/markdown/week4/2022/09/16/docker.html) I took to do my local server |
| 3 | Creative Development | [Review Ticket 3](https://github.com/vivianknee/FastPages/issues/9#issue-1369289899) | This week, we focused on creating a sample create task in preparation for the AP exam using javascript and code.org app lab. Here is the [blog](https://vivianknee.github.io/FastPages/markdown/week3/2022/09/07/AppLabquiz.html) I wrote during the process. |
| 2 | Data Abstraction | [Review Ticket 2](https://github.com/vivianknee/FastPages/issues/8#issue-1360542831) | This week we started learning about  [Lists, Dictionaries, and Iterations](https://vivianknee.github.io/FastPages/jupyter/week2/2022/08/30/lists.html) and how to store data with them. We learned how to print and format dictionaries as well as do other more advanced things with them. In addition, we also messed around with html and the themes of our website. For example we applied a dark mode css file which changed the entire look of the site. |
| 1 | Intro to Python | [Review Ticket 1](https://github.com/vivianknee/FastPages/issues/7#issue-1353739633) | This week was super busy and more code heavy. Specifically, we began using python and bash. Using python, we made a [Python Quiz](https://vivianknee.github.io/FastPages/jupyter/week1/2022/08/28/python.html) and with bash we created a [Bash Tool Check](https://vivianknee.github.io/FastPages/jupyter/week1/2022/08/22/toolcheck.html). The bash tool check made sure that we had all the necessary programs installed. This week was also an opportunity to personalize our website so I made a page consisting of  [My Art with Images and Tables](https://vivianknee.github.io/FastPages/markdown/noncsp/week1/2022/08/24/My-Art.html). Finally, we had to show proof of our blogging both in csp which I did through [APCSP Vocab](https://vivianknee.github.io/FastPages/Vocab/) and for [Schoolwork](https://vivianknee.github.io/FastPages/markdown/noncsp/week1/2022/08/28/school-classwork.html) outside of csp. |
| 0 | Tool Setup | [Review Ticket 0](https://github.com/vivianknee/FastPages/issues/6#issue-1347442011) | We learned how to make our first markdown posts and jupyter notebooks. My first makedown post was my [About Me](https://vivianknee.github.io/FastPages/about/) and my [First Post](https://vivianknee.github.io/FastPages/markdown/week0/2022/08/22/My-First-Post.html). In order to do this, we had to set up wsl, vscode, and download numerous other programs like anaconda, bash, python, and more. |
